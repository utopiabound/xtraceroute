.SH NAME
xtraceroute \- graphical (X11) traceroute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xtraceroute
.I "[options] [hostname]"
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page briefly documents the
.BR xtraceroute ,
command.
This manual page was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux 
distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.
Since then the author has gotten his act together and keeps it up to
date.
.PP
.B xtraceroute
is a graphical version of the traceroute
program, which traces the route your IP packets
travel to their destination. 
.PP
On the display:
.PP
* Green dots have good location information that came from LOC fields in 
the DNS, which is the best data out there.
.PP
* Orange ones has been guessed from the sites' suffix.
.PP
* Yellow ones got resolved via a database of city names and "known" routers.
That data is old and inaccurate and it's not getting any younger.
.PP
* Red ones are completely unknown.
.PP
* You can select dots by clicking on them both on the globe and in the list.
.PP
* Pressing and holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse will rotate
the globe. Using the middle mouse button will move it, and the right mouse 
button will zoom it (only vertical movement counts). You can generally get
the view you want this way.
.PP
.SH ARGUMENTS
hostname is the name (or IP address) of the host you are interested in. 
.SH OPTIONS
The program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show version number
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display a brief help text.
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-texture texture-name
Use a custom texture (map). It can be any kind of file that gdk_pixbuf can 
load (which is most reasonable formats).
There are a few really good textures on http://www.radcyberzine.com/xglobe/
(Meant for use with Xglobe, but they'll work fine here as well.)
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-ntexture texture-name
Use a custom texture (map) for the part of the earth that's not lit by
the sun.
.TP
.B \-\-night, \-\-no-night
Do/Don't use the night texture where appropriate. The default is to do
an all-day earth.
.TP
.B \-\-LOD number
Set the level-of-detail for the sphere.
(The default is 3, 0-4 are realistic values.)
.TP
.B \-\-stdin, -
Makes the program read data from stdin instead of calling 
.BR traceroute (8) 
(Mainly useful for debugging)
.SH CAVEATS
.B xtraceroute 
tries hard to guess the location of machines, but it is just 
software, it doesn't know everything, and it makes mistakes. 
.PP
The yellow dots has been guessed by looking at the top level domain (TLD)
of the hostname. This works fairly well for most countries, but there's a
few exceptions where some small countries (like Niue (.nu) and Tuvalu (.tv))
will let anyone register domains in their space for a fee. I don't care,
If it says .nu and it hasn't got a LOC record, it'll get plotted in Niue.
Also, very few US sites actually use the .us TLD.
.PP
If it finds a very high-latency link, it will assume it it a satellite
hop and plot it accordingly. If you have some other kind of slow link, 
like PPP over something slow or a really busy router, it might show up
as a satellite hop as well.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I @prefix@/share/xtraceroute/earth.png
Default texture for the earth.
.TP
.I @prefix@/share/xtraceroute/night.png
Default night-time texture for the earth.
.TP
.I @prefix@/share/xtraceroute/xtraceroute-resolve-location.sh
This is a script that xtraceroute uses to get data on sites in a nice
asynchronous way. It's not very interesting by itself.
.TP
.I @prefix@/share/xtraceroute/site_hosts.cache
System-wide hosts file (optional)
.TP
.I @prefix@/share/xtraceroute/site_networks.cache
System-wide networks file (optional)
.PP
The two files above are filled in by hand, following the model
of
.I /usr/lib/xtraceroute 
*.cache files.
.TP
.I $HOME/.xt/user_hosts.cache 
Your personal hosts file
.TP
.I $HOME/.xt/user_networks.cache 
Your personal networks file
.TP
.I $HOME/.xt/user_generic.cache 
Your personal base of regular expressions 
.PP
These three personal files are typically filled in via the 
.B Database 
menu.
.SH "LOC data"
The Correct Way to tell the geographical location of a host on the
internet is to ask the DNS. The way to do that is described in RFC1876,
which defines the LOC (for location) RR. It's not exactly widely used,
but you see it every now and then. Hopefully this program can help
change that.

How to get LOC data for your site into the DNS:

Ask your local sysadmin that maintain your nameserver to read the RFC.
It's a fairly easy read as RFCs go, but it might help if you find out 
the location of your site in advance using, say, a GPS or a site like
http://www.mapblast.com. Sysadmins are busy people.

When xtraceroute tries to resolve a hostname it will try the proper name
first, and then higher domains. For example if our hostname is 
"apa.bepa.cepa.com", it will try that, "bepa.cepa.com" and "cepa.com".
(But not just "com")

This means that if you're a big site and it's hard to persuade the admins  
to add individual LOC entries for all machines, you can try getting them
to add one or two for the whole domain.
