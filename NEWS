0.9.0
-----
The most important change in 0.9.0 from 0.8.14 (and various 0.8.15-preX 
versions) is that using the RFC1876 ("LOC") informations from the DNS is
now supported. To use this, you need the "host" program by Eric
Wassenar, from ftp://ftp.nikhef.nl/pub/network/

Get it from there, build, install, and if you have to, use the 
"--with-host=/path/to/it" option to ./configure.

There's a few eyecandy improvements as well, you get to zoom and pan,
and satellites look like satellites.

0.8.14:
-------
Big news for 0.8.14 is i18n support, and language files.

If you use this, and have a problem which doesn't seem to be related to it
directly (ie xtraceroute displays things wrongly somehow), please use
the C locale for the bug report. It's interesting, but not really
helpful getting bugreports in languages you don't speak or read.

If you find a bug in the actual translation, see the ABOUT-NLS file.

For now: please keep backups of your cache-files. I'm working on some
very experimental code to allow updating the databases. This involves
writing to them, and you people know what can happen then...
