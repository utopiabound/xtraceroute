Stuff done are "V"ed. Undone stuff have stars. "Z"s are for stuff on hold.

* Build a smarter/faster grepfunction for db and countries. Hashtable?
* At least use hashing on the ndg-style databases. 
* Hostfiles are easy.
Z Make an incremental makeearth() istead of making a new displaylist every
  time. Might not be possible. Several displaylists? Won't do it, performance
  would hurt.
Z Give each boep a quadric of their own, saves changing the quadrics color.
  Might not improve the speed anyway.
Z All boeps seem to end up about one degree or so to the east. Might be a
  bad texture problem.
Z Open a popup menu on middle mouse button with the info instead of just
  printing it to stdout.
Z Texture problem by the poles.
    (Fixed to some extent. It's as good as it gets using only triangles.
     See comments in code.)
* Call traceroute with -n (don't resolve names) and do it myself since I
  have to talk to the nameserver anyway to support above RFCs.
Z Add option to make the earth semitransparent, to see the boeps and yellow
  lines on the other side. I wonder if that's really smart... 
* Come up with a new name. "Xtraceroute" sounds wa-a-a-y to boring, and it
  doesn't describe the fact that the point of the program
  is in the IP-address/hostname <-> geographical coordinates mapping.
* Center the earth (autorotate) so that the last traced site is centered.
  Maybe make this an option...
* Make mode to fly along the path. Naaaaahh....
-----
* Split _lots_ of stuff off of k.c and into smaller files.
  (Done to some extent.)
* Remove _lots_ of global data.
  (Done to some extent.)
* I could make a way to export files that can be inserted right
  into the DNS server for RFC1876 data. Hmm... (probably no use, it's 
  pretty simple anyway.)
* Make the spinner nicer.
* Add a light where the sun is. Realistic lighting depending on time of day.
  I'll probably have to do multitexturing to get this to work.
* Add actual helpful messages to all the "help"-buttons.
* RIPE/ARIN for IP-> World? (whois)
* Add spinbuttons for the numerical entry of lat/lon in the database dialogs.
* Fix double declarations in xt.h. SGIs compiler is pretty vocal about this...
* Use real regexps instead of just grepping in the (generic, internal)
  databases (maybe globs would be better.) Yup. Use fnmatch for this.
* Generalize the databases more.
* Do something *nice* when a routerloop occurs, instead of just stacking
  sitemarkers sky high.
Z Add option to specify flags to traceroute. (Or should this be compiled
  in? It's not changing much...)
* Make a colored marker in the clist to indicate accuracy.

* New async helper for the caida stuff.
* New async helper for whois.
*   Maybe make one program to do caida/whois/host and put all this complexity
    in there instead?
* From mail: "the node under exploration could e.g. flash on the map"
* From mail: "Showing country flags of the hosts on the list."
* From mail: "sites should have comments in the file, just like nets do."
* Do a cool graduated transition from day to night. (Pretty easy)
* There should be a way to update the day/might line. you can switch do
  day-only mode and back, but that's not vey nice.
* Zoom should affect wheter sites get placed on top of each other or
  not. (Since the markers are about the same size regardless of zoom)
* Bring name resolution in house via bind libs.
